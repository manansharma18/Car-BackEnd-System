# Car-BackEnd-System
In this project, I have used our skills with Spring Boot, APIs, documentation and testing to implement a Vehicles API that serves as an endpoint to track 
vehicle inventory. While the primary Vehicles API will perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete) related to vehicle details like make, model, 
color, etc., it will need to consume data from other APIs as well regarding location and pricing data. You will implement a RESTful API for the Vehicles API, 
as well as converting a Pricing Service API to a microservice.

The microservices are registered on a Eureka Server.
